    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Soccer is one of the few sports that gathers millions of people across the world and is internationally acclaimed. It is also one of the sports in the top 10 list of \"Highest Paid Sports\", and has some of the most popular players on the list of \"Highest Paid Athletes\". Soccer players often attract million dollar deals when joining teams as well as marketing campaigns given that according to \"World Atlas\" it is the most popular sport in the world. On this project, our team will aim to analyze the factors that drive soccer player wages and use real data to predict the wages. Through the project we will try to understand what are the most valued characteristics on a player that may be a key piece on their value and wage. "

    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Can the player stats of a soccer player accurately indicate their wage and/or value?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We know soccer is sport that attracts a lot of money but is drive by the fame of outstanding players so by answering this question on merely game stats we can use it as an indicator of bias on wages. Perhaps a player with good stats does not always get the same wage as another player with similar stats but lower international recognition and fame.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. By creating predictive models, can we determine whether a player is overpaid or underpaid?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our research, experts argue that wages are driven by supply and demand. The talent is scarce and lots of teams want talented players. This logic indicates that better players get paid well which is true for really popular players but what data can we discover when we look at all players across the table?\n",

    "## Data to be Used\n",
    "\n",
    "For the project we will be using the FIFA's track of records with ove 18000 observations, one for each player. The dataset provides the statistics for each player as well as their physical features relevant to their performance which are all depicted through numeric data. Moreover, the dataset includes categorical data that indicates the player's nationality, preferred foot, current team and position. We will use this data to create three predictive models and answer the below questions."

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data has 89 attributes that describe the players which speaks to the complexity of the sport. As part of our approach we will use thorough reasearch and domain knowledge acquisition as well as feature selection strategies and algorithems to narrow down numeric variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use *Multiple Linear Regression* to determine if a player's stats can accurately determine their wage and/or value. After narrowing down the number of features, we will also find the least amount of information one may need to know about a player to determine its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project will use *Support Vector Machine Regression* to determine if a player's stats, nationaly, club, or other features we will discover, can help predict the wage and/or value of similar players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we will use the regression algorithm *Polynomial Regression* with the numeric data in order to find a model with better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensembling\n",
    "\n",
    "The aforementiones models will inform our ensemble model by outputing the predicted value of the wage. We will use a boosting method of ensemble such as to build on the model's learnings and find the most accuracy. Research has indicated how better players get paid higher but other sources have shown how the Club and popularity can be an influence. Our model will have a holistic approach by first implementing the regression with just the player's stats and incorporating some of the categorical variables when appropiate."
